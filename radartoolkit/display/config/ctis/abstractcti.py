class AbstractCti(BaseTreeItem):
    """ TreeItem for use in a ConfigTreeModel. (CTI = Config Tree Item)

        Abstract class. You must implement the _enforceDataType method that ensures the the data
        is stored internally in the correct type. Also, implement the createEditor method if you
        want you CTI to be editable (which is usually the case). If your CTI is not editable, make
        sure that valueColumnItemFlags does not return Qt.ItemIsEditable to prevent createEditor
        from being called by the delegate.

        Just like the BaseTreeItem every node has a name and a full path that is a slash-separated
        string of the full path leading from the root node to the current node. For instance, the
        path may be '/scale/x', the nodeName in that case is 'x'.

        CTIs are used to store a certain configuration value. It can be queried by the configValue
        property. The type of this value differs between descendants of AbstractCti, but a sub class
        should always return the same type. For example, the ColorCti.value always returns a
        QColor object. The displayValue returns the string representation for use in the tables;
        by default this returns: str(self.value)

        The underlying data is usually stored in that type as well but this is not necessarily so.
        A ChoiceCti, which represents a combo box, stores a list of choices and an index that is
        the actual choice made by the user. ChoiceCti.data contains the index while
        ChoiceCti.configValue returns: choices[index]. Note that the constructor expects the data
        as input parameter. The constructor calls the _enforceDataType method to convert the data
        to the correct type.

        The purpose of the defaultData is to reset a config data to its initial value when the
        user clicks on the reset button during editing.
